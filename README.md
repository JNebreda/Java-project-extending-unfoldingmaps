# Java-project-extending-unfoldingmaps

This project has been developed in Eclipse. The main class is called EducationEqualityRatio. It shows in a map the ratio of girls to boys enrolled at secondary level in public and private schools. It extends the Unfolding library. The country shapes are loaded from a GeoJSON file via a data reader and the data from a CSV file provided by data.worldbank.org.
